This a team project done by Abdul-Lateef Yusuff and Jesse Okoro

In this project we will be joining hands to create a shell, a simple shell precisely

##Day One##

Creted the prompt
handle ctrl+d
print eroor
some memory management

##Day Two##

Implemented the execution process by first creating child process
But execution can only handle path as an argument with no space
